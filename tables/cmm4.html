<h3>
		   ============Introduction============
</h3>
We provide a set of files for the SCEC Crustal Motion Model,
Version 4.0 (CMM), which describes the motion of a large number of geodetic
monuments in Southern California. These motions were estimated from a 
combination of EDM, GPS, and VLBI data. The procedure followed is described
in more detail in a paper: "A Unified Analysis of Crustal Motion in California, 1970-2004: 
The SCEC Crustal Motion Map", a draft of which is included in this release as a 
<A HREF = "SCEC_cmm4.pdf">PDF file</A>, and to be submitted to BSSA.  

<P>
<h3>
		============Horizontal Velocities============
</h3>
The files: 

<P>
<A HREF ="velh.cmm4"> velh.cmm4 </A>
<br>
<A HREF ="velh.largeerr.cmm4"> velh.largeerr.cmm4 </A>
<br>
<A HREF ="velh.nontect.cmm4"> velh.nontect.cmm4 </A>
<br>
<A HREF ="velh.reject.cmm4"> velh.reject.cmm4 </A>
<P>

contain horizontal velocities for those sites for which such velocities
could be estimated. The first file provides these for sites that we believe
are reliable. The next three files are: (1) sites for which the errors are
very large; (2) sites for which the motion is real but probably affected
by nontectonic sources (geothermal areas and a large reservoir); (3) sites
which we believe are otherwise unreliable.

<P>
The format of these files is: 

<br>
Column 1: Site name and type. The names are 4-character codes; the type is
	either _GPS (continuous or survey-mode GPS), _EDM (US Geological
	Survey trilateration) or _VLB (fixed or mobile VLBI). If a point
	was used by more than one technique, the name will appear more than
	once; for example, site PINY was observed both by mobile VLBI and by
	survey-mode GPS, and REDH served first as a trilateration point and
	than as a point for survey-mode GPS.
<br>
Column 2: Site latitude.
<br>
Column 3: Site longitude, positive for East.
<br>
Column 4: East velocity (in a local East-North-Up framework), relative to the
	North American plate, in mm/yr.
<br>
Column 5: Standard error of the East velocity.
<br>
Column 6: North velocity (in a local East-North-Up framework), relative to the
	North American plate, in mm/yr.
<br>
Column 7: Standard error of the North velocity.
<br>
Column 8: Correlation between the East and North velocities.
<br>
Column 9: Number of epochs used in estimate. For most of the time covered,
	GPS data were combined into monthly files; after large earthquakes, a
	smaller temporal spacing was used. (See the file  epochplot.pdf).
	The number of epochs is therefore not equivalent to the number of
	days of occupation, but should give a useful sense of how many data
	went into the final velocity estimate.  For the EDM and VLBI data,
	the number of epochs corresponds more closely to the number of
	occupations.
<br>
Column 10: The time span, in years, from the first to the last epoch.
<br>
Column 11: The average of the epoch times.
<P>

After column 11, there may be additional entries to indicate ties between
sites. These ties are assigned a letter I if the tie was "hard", forcing the
velocities at tied sites to be identical, or a letter s if the tie was "soft",
allowing some variation. For example,

<br>
CHAF_GPS  34.3006 -119.3310 -29.13 0.36  28.23 0.32  0.020    5  8.6 1991.5 I034
<br>
SOLI_GPS  34.2983 -119.3427 -29.13 0.36  28.24 0.32  0.020   12 16.2 1993.6 I034
<br>

means that these two nearby sites have been forced to have the same horizontal
velocity, and
<br>

REDH_EDM  35.6050 -120.2606 -22.16 0.47  26.04 0.40  0.096   56 19.0 1980.6 s055
<br>
REDH_GPS  35.6050 -120.2606 -23.23 0.40  26.11 0.38 -0.008   15 11.5 1995.2 s055
<br>

that these two sites, which are the same mark observed with different methods
(largely used over different times) have been constrained to have similar
velocities. These ties have been used both to tie the VLBI and GPS reference
frames, and to set the rigid-body rotation for the trilateration networks.

<h3>
		============Vertical Velocities============
</h3>

The files:

<br>
<A HREF ="velu.reject.cmm4"> velu.reject.cmm4 </A>
<P>

contain vertical velocities for those sites for which such velocities
could be estimated. The first file provides these for sites that we believe
are reliable. The next three files are: (1) sites for which the errors are
very large; (2) sites for which the motion is real but probably affected
by nontectonic sources (geothermal areas and a large reservoir); (3) sites
which we believe are otherwise unreliable.

<P>
The format of these files is: 

<br>
Column 1: Site name and type. The names are 4-character codes; the type is
	either _GPS (continuous or survey-mode GPS), or _VLB (fixed or mobile
	VLBI); vertical velocities cannot be reliably estimated from the
	trilateration data. If a point was used by more than one technique,
	the name will appear more than once; for example, site PINY was
	observed both by mobile VLBI and by survey-mode GPS.
<br>
Column 2: Site latitude.
<br>
Column 3: Site longitude, positive for East.
<br>
Column 4: Vertical velocity (in a local East-North-Up framework), in mm/yr,
	positive up. Because of possible systematic errors, the zero level
	should not be assumed to be zero velocity relative to the geoid, the
	ellipsoid, or sea level.
<br>
Column 5: Standard error of the vertical velocity.
<br>
Column 6: Correlation between the East and vertical velocities.
<br>
Column 7: Correlation between the North and vertical velocities.
<br>
Column 8: Number of epochs used in estimate. For most of the time covered,
	GPS data were combined into monthly files; after large earthquakes, a
	smaller temporal spacing was used. (See the file  epochplot.pdf).
	The number of epochs is therefore not equivalent to the number of
	days of occupation, but should give a useful sense of how many data
	went into the final velocity estimate.  For the EDM and VLBI data,
	the number of epochs corresponds more closely to the number of
	occupations.
<br>
Column 9: The time span, in years, from the first to the last epoch.
<br>
Column 10: The average of the epoch times.

<h3>
		============Coseismic Offsets============
</h3>
The file: 
<P>
<A HREF ="coseismic.cmm4"> coseismic.cmm4 </A>
<P>

contains estimates of offsets of sites at the times of large earthquakes.
<P>

The format of the file is:

<br>
Column 1: Site name (4 character code). All offsets are from GPS data. Note
	that there are sites included that are not in the velocity file:
	in these cases there was enough data to estimate an offset, but not
	a velocity.
<br>
Column 2: Site latitude.
<br>
Column 3: Site longitude, positive for East.
<br>
Column 4: Time of the offset, in decimal years. The correspondence between
	times and earthquakes is:

<h3>
		============Postseismic Motions============
</h3>

The file: 
<P>
<A HREF ="postseismic.cmm4"> postseismic.cmm4 </A>
<P>

contains estimates of postseismic motions of sites after large earthquakes.
All postseismic motions are modeled as
<P>
	
	u(t) = D*log(1+t/10)
<P>

where
	D is the amplitude,
	the log function is the common logarithm, and
	t is the time in days from the time of the earthquake.
<P>

The format of the file is:
<br>
Column 1: Site name (4 character code). All estimates are from GPS data. Note
	that there are sites included that are not in the velocity or
	offset files: in these cases there was enough data to estimate
	postseismic motions only.
<br>
Column 2: Site latitude.
<br>
Column 3: Site longitude, positive for East.
<br>
Column 4: Time of the earthquake, in decimal years. The correspondence between
	times and earthquakes is:

<h3>
		============Site Information============
</h3>
The file: 
<P>
<A HREF ="stationlist.cmm4"> stationlist.cmm4 </A>
<P>

contains coordinates and a brief description of the sites.
<P>

The format of the file is:
<br>

Column 1: Site name (4 character code).
<br>
Column 2: Site latitude.
<br>
Column 3: Site longitude, positive for East.
<br>
Column 4: The elevation above the ellipsoid, in meters.
<P>

The remainder of each line gives some station information. If this is ALL CAPS
it is either the stamping of the monument, or else (if it contains underscore
characters) the PBO designation for a continuous GPS site. Lowercase
information is either a description of an unstamped monument, or the name of a
continuous GPS or VLBI site; note that mobile VLBI sites have convntional
monuments.

The file: 
<P>
<A HREF ="timeseries.cmm4"> timeseries.cmm4 </A>
<P>

gives the residual timeseries for each site, after the quantities estimated
above (velocities, offsets, and postseismic signals) have been removed.

<br>
Column 2: Time of value.
<br>
Column 3: East residual displacement, in mm.
