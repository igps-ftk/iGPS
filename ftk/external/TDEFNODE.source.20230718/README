README for TDEFNODE 2015.07.30

TDEFNODE is the time-dependent version of DEFNODE and has many changes. DEFNODE control files will not work in TDEFNODE.

You may use TDEFNODE but do not make changes or redistribute. It has enough bugs already.

This version supersedes any previous versions that are floating around. If you are using a previous version, upgrade before asking me any questions.

INSTALLATION:

1. Uncompress the contents of the compressed file TDEFNODE.tar.gz in a TDEFNODE directory ( ~/TDEFNODE recommended).
If you will use the supplied plotting scripts, make an alias (syntax depends on shell):

set TD_HOME = ~/TDEFNODE 
(or whatever your directory is) and add this to your PATH.

2. Set array dimensions within 'tdefcom1.h'. The dimensions are set in a fortran PARAMETER statement and all start with MAX_ . 
(don't set them to 0). Be sure to keep the structure of the PARAMETER statement intact. Exceeding array dimensions is not always checked 
explicitly and can cause strange behavior. Where dimensions are checked and exceeded, the program will quit and give a message.

3. {Optional} Set paths to the volcanoes (votw.gmt; needed if +vtw flag set) and 
earthquakes (ehb.gmt; needed if +eqk flag set) files in the file 'tdeffiles.h' (see instructions in 'tdeffiles.h' file) if
you want to include these in the profile files. 
For example:

c- Smithsonian volcanoes file (optional, see code for format)
c- path of volcanoes file
      volcfile = '/home/mcc/TDEFNODE/votw.gmt'

c- Engdahl et al. earthquakes file (optional, see code for format)
c- path of earthquake file(s)
      num_quakefiles = 1
      quakefile(1) = '/home/mcc/TDEFNODE/ehb.gmt'


4. Edit the Makefile to your specifications.

5. Run 'make' to compile. Success depends on your compiler.

RUNNING:

If you type 

% tdefnode

the program will ask for the control file name and the model name. Or type the control file name as a command line argument:

% tdefnode control_file_name

Or also type model name as second command line argument:

% tdefnode control_file_name model_name

Runtime messages are all output to the screen. Many files are generated in the directory named the 4-character model name as discussed in the manual.

The manual is a group of .html files. The main one is tdefnode.html which links to the others.
