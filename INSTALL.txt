First, unpack the iGPS source files (iGPS.tar.bz2) to a directory, 
  say ~/iGPS. 


There are two methods to start iGPS:

1.Include the iGPS root path (~/iGPS) and its sub-directories in 
  IDL system variable !PATH. Type igps in IDL to start iGPS GUI.

2.Run the ~/iGPS/main/start_igps.pro script directly in IDL.

For more information, please refer to the iGPS Step-by-step Tutorial
  in ${iGPS_ROOT}/doc directory:
  iGPS_tutorial.pdf

Enjoy yourself.
