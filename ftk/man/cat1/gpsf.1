NAME
     gpsf - A  collection  of  programs  written  in  Fortran  77
     language, developed by Yunfeng Tian.

SYNOPSIS
     NONE

DESCRIPTION
     GPSF programs collection is based  upon  some  libraries  of
     GAMIT/GLOBK,  NRF.  The objective is to create a free source
     tool for analyzing CGPS coordinate time series.

     Preface
     I found that it is diffecult to analyze the CGPS coordinates
     time series as those did in those papers published in JGR-SE
     and BSSA. I cannot  find  their  codes  somewhere.  Thus,  I
     decided  to write my own codes to test their results, and to
     do some improvements as well. I supposed I could obtain  the
     same (maybe almost the same) results as the original authors
     did. But Roman wasn't built in one day.  I  feared  that  my
     programs  may produce results with much large untertainties,
     or even errous products. But this is a good step  anyway.  I
     hope I could do better than them.

          *GAMIT/GLOBK is developed by MIT/SIO/etc.

          *NRF-Numerical Recipe in Fortran 77.
          *There are also some shell scripts which are related to
          general operations with CGPS data, such as downloading,
          conversion. Those scripts  are  mostly  written  in  sh
          shell,  some  in Csh, and serveral revised from that in
          GAMIT/GLOBK collection.

INSTALL
     1. Get the distribution.
     It is recommened that the GPSF source codes are extracted to
     the home directory of one user, say, ~/gpsf. Install GPSF to
     other directory may cause some compilation problems.
     To extract,
       tar jxvf gpsf.tar.bz2
     In Solaris, you could do,
       gtar jxvf gpsf.tar.bz2
     Or,
       bzcat gpsf.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

     2.Set the environment varible.
     Before install GPSF, add  the  GPSF_HOME/com  to  your  PATH
     environment variable.
     For _c_s_h, add a line like below to ~/._c_s_h_r_c:
      set path = (~/gpsf/cgps/com $path)
     Then, _s_o_u_r_c_e ~/._c_s_h_r_c.
     For _s_h/_b_a_s_h, edit the ~/._s_h_r_c or ~/._b_a_s_h_r_c file:
      export PATH=$PATH:~/gpsf/cgps/com
     Then, reload it, say,  ". ~/._b_a_s_h_r_c".

     3.Generate GAMIT/GLOBK library file.
     GAMIT/GLOBK library file (gglib.a.ARCH) should be placed  in
     the same directory as GPSF. However, the _a_r_l_i_b utility place
     it in the home directory of  one  user,  say,  ~/gglib.  You
     should  move  this directory to the same parent path of GPSF
     mannually. In GPSF, the relative path (not  abosolute  path-
     name) are used.
     Simply run the _a_r_l_i_b command will create the library file.
     Before do it, make sure that the ~/gg  link  points  to  the
     GAMIT/GLOBK  path.  _a_r_l_i_b  will  search all *.a file, unpack
     them, repack it into one file, and then create  the  gglib.a
     library file.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
     I'd like to thank Google for its search  engine  which  pro-
     vided  me  much  information  about GPS. Thanks also goes to
     those institutes who  provide  the  most  prominent  journal
     papers  at  no cost. Also, I thanks my family for continuous
     supports.
     This project is supported by the  "Director  Fund"  of  ICD,
     CEA--Noise   Analysis   of   CGPS  coordinates  Time  Series
     (J2207820).
