NAME
     asc2bin_sio - Convert ASCII SIO data file into  binary  for-
     mat, for the purpose of accelerating reading speed.

SYNOPSIS
     asc2bin_sio   file   _o_f_i_l_e

DESCRIPTION
     IDL handles large ASCII matrix very slowly at  first,  which
     is  a  result  of  BAD  reading algorithm. After revised the
     algorithm of reading files, the speed is acceptable now.

     NONE.

EXAMPLES
      asc2bin_sio
