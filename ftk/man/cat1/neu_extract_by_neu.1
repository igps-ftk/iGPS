NAME
     neu_extract_by_neu - Extract  time  series  from  continuous
     (day  by day) mass loading displacements created by _m_l_o_a_d of
     _Q_O_C_A program according to the epochs in one GPS time  series
     (say SIO/neu files).

SYNOPSIS
     neu_extract_by_neu path opath

DESCRIPTION
     _n_e_u__e_x_t_r_a_c_t__b_y__n_e_u _m_l_o_a_d  usually  outputs  continuous  dis-
     placements  series  for a time span constrainted by meteoro-
     logical observations (say, NCEP Reanalysis surface  pressure
     observations--pres.sfc.YEAR).  However,  there  are  more or
     less data gaps in observed GPS positions time  series.  This
     purpose of this program is to extract the corresponding dis-
     placement time series according GPS series.

     _p_a_t_h Input data path.

     _o_p_a_t_h Oputput data path.
