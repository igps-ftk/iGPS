NAME
     l_l_r2llrs_panga - Convert  PANGA  LAT/LON/RAD  format  into
     SIO/NEU form.

SYNOPSIS
     l_l_r2llrs_panga

DESCRIPTION
     The PANGA time series are stored in separate files for  each
     component  (lat/lon/rad).  And  the length of each component
     may vary for the same station, which makes it difficult  for
     general  time  series  analysis.  This  program combines the
     coordiantes from three files into one which conforms to  the
     SIO/NEU format.
