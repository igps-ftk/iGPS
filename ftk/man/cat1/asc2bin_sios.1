NAME
     asc2bin_sios - Convert ASCII SIO  data  files  in  specified
     path  into  binary  format,  for the purpose of accelerating
     reading speed.

SYNOPSIS
     asc2bin_sios   path   _o_p_a_t_h

DESCRIPTION
     IDL handles large ASCII matrix very slowly at  first,  which
     is  a  result  of  BAD  reading algorithm. After revised the
     algorithm of reading files, the speed is acceptable now.

     _p_a_t_h this is the input path name.

     _o_p_a_t_h
          this is the output path name.

OPTIONS
     NONE.

EXAMPLES
      asc2bin_sio
