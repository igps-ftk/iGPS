     (*.a).

SYNOPSIS
     arlib

DESCRIPTION
     arlib will create a ~/gglib/gglib.a  file  from  GAMIT/GLOBK
     compiled    libraries    under   ~/gg/   directories.   Some
     functions/routines are eliminated before archiving to  avoid
     problems.

EXAMPLES
      arlib

BUGS
     find problem in linked path.
          The ~/gg is a symbolic link to /usr/local/gamit  direc-
          tory.
          The command  "find  ~/gg"  returns  none  in  RH9.  And
          surprisingly,  when  "cd  ~/gg",  it  did not enter the
          linked directory /usr/lcoal/gamit, like  in  the  other
          systems (say, Solaris).
