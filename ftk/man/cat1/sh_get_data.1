NAME
     sh_get_data* - A revied version of gamit counterpart.

SYNOPSIS
     sh_get_data

DESCRIPTION
     GAG GPS archive has a different directories  structure  from
     that  of  KASI/CDDIS.  Thus, we cannot just ncftp get -R the
     YYd directory from those IGS  data  servers.   Instead,  the
     get_*  executables under ~/gpsf/cgps/dc/get directory should
     be used to download data and products from IGS data&products
     centers.  Scripts sh_get_data_YEAR have been obsolete.

     NONE.

EXAMPLES
      sh_get_data
